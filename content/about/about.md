## Summary
I select the right fit for the problem, keep systems practical, and avoid unnecessary complexity. I automate what makes sense, build for failure, and treat monitoring and cost control as first‑class requirements. Scaling and HA are valuable, but over‑engineering isn’t. I take pride in what I ship and fully own the systems I operate.

## Focus Areas
- **Container Orchestration**: Reliable Kubernetes and container platforms  
- **CI/CD**: Robust pipelines with tests and safe releases  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Modular IaC with secrets management  
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible and maintainable config systems  
- **Security First**: Secure-by-design infrastructure and workflows  
- **Cost Discipline**: Right-sizing, efficiency, and long-term sustainability  
- **Agentic Systems**: Passionate about agentic workflows; build and deploy agents with knowledge bases
