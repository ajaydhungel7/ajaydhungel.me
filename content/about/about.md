## Summary  
I select the right fit for the problem, keep systems practical, and avoid unnecessary complexity. I automate what makes sense, build for failure, and treat monitoring and cost control as first‑class requirements. Scaling and HA are valuable, but over‑engineering isn’t. I take pride in what I ship and fully own the systems I operate.

## Focus Areas  
- **AWS Infrastructure**: EKS, ECS, Lambda, CloudWatch, databases  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, modular IaC for multi-env  
- **Observability**: Monitoring, alerting, and incident workflows  
- **Automation**: CI/CD and operational tooling  
- **GenAI Platform**: MCP server + Agno agents for product workflows
